                            <h3>Driving Community Impact</h3>
                            <p>For me I focused with my own university tech community. I decided to focus on allowing and broadening the scope for those who have access to applied based learning. I led a 12-week iOS course and spearheaded the hackathon movement at ASU. The interest and support for these movements were so amazing I had to continue.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With Desert Hacks, after raising $50,000 for the first iteration, we went and wanted to grow the span and outreach of the hackathon. While we made an impact on 200+ students last year in a new and awesome co-working tech space, Galvanize, we want to bring students from across the nation to the largest public university in the world! My goal is to create a more inclusive and diverse tech scene before I graduate in May 2018 from ASU.
                            </p>
                            <p> With CodePath, I not only petitioned to have it on the ASU campus by obtaining 100 signatures but also led a class of 20+ students through a rigourous iOS bootcamp that is used to train Senior Engineers at Silicoln Valley as well as Facebook University Students. I joined on board their non-profit, CodePath.org to expand their university initative by providing iOS and Cybersecurity courses at no cost to a wide range of universities.
                            </p>
                            <p> I had the amazing opportunity with CodePath to drive impact at Facebook by mentoring students at Facebook University with iOS as well as drove cross-functional partnerships between the Facebook Security Team, Universities, professors, and students.

                              <p>At Workiva, I joined on board as a member of the Quality Assurance team and strengthened my knowledge of testing protocols and tools that are currently used. I learned a new language, DART, as well as worked with Sauce to automate tests. The highlight of the internship was to redesign an internal tool which developers in the company could use to increase their efficiency. Overall, it was fun to communicate accross a variety of teams in order to relay the testing practices and protocols to make sure the development team is aligned with how to write and deploy tests.</p>
